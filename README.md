# BYOZ â€” Broadcast Your Own Z

## What is this?

BYOZ (Broadcast Your Own Z) is my personal experiment where I record every minute of my working screen via [the discrete VAE](https://github.com/openai/DALL-E) and publish the latent representations computed by the model. The latent variable in VAEs is `z`, which is where the name comes from.

The script I use for recording my screen can be found here: [byoz](byoz) (this works only on Mac).
